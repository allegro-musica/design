# Allegro Musica Design Notes for 07.10.2020

## Agenda

We worked together to create the Gantt chart on Excel thanks to simultaneous working available with the MS Apps.

### Topics
- Plan the software that we are going to use
- Complete Gantt chart on Excel

## Discussion

We came up with a comprehensive plan outlining each stage of our project to manage our time properly and not have to face any delays. We created a Gantt chart as a team where each member was given tasks to complete and we planned these until the end of the project so, at each stage we all know what to do.
