## Topics

- We discussed what we had done so far and planned what we would do for each stage of the project.
- Copy data from Excel to Project

## Discussion

As a team we have continued to look at different designs for the app, we also tried to create a flowchart for the app, for example we had a look what will be the start page of the app and what pages will be available afterwards. We have copied all the data from our Excel Gantt chart to Microsoft Project for better management and visualization.

**Conclusion**

We couldn’t decide what pages will be available in the app because one of the team members was missing and we didn’t know what content will be in the app. We have finished moving data from the Excel Gantt chart into the new Microsoft Project.
