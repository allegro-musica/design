# Allegro Musica Design Notes for 07.10.2020

## Agenda

We thought about the design and implementation of the ideas into our app.

## Topics

- Homepage and category page design.
- Implementation of idea in app.
- A simple and enjoyable approach to teaching music theory.

## Discussion

As a team we thought about the implantation of the ideas, also reflecting on the design and UI, and UX. We decided to have three pages with a navigation bar on the bottom, and the category page would have different colored cards representing the different levels and topics. The third page would be the achievements page that would also be accessed from the homepage.
