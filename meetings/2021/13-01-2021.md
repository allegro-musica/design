**Conclusion**

We have concluded that we are going ahead and implementing the focus change proposal. In addition, we have concluded that
we are going to change the requirements of the app due to not knowing about music and therefore not having the necessary
skills required to make the app. Therefore, we have concluded to make a quiz app that will allow the user to create, host
and participate to quiz with other users. All the reason why we are changing the requirements can
be found in [change proposal](../../proposals/focus-change.md) and [major proposal](../../proposals/mayor-change.md).
